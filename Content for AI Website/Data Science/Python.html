    <h1>Python</h1>
    <p>Python is a programming language widely used by Data Scientists.</p>
    <p>Python has in-built mathematical libraries and functions, making it easier to calculate mathematical problems and to perform data analysis.</p>
    <p>We will provide practical examples using Python.</p>
    <h2>Python Libraries</h2>
    <p>Python has libraries with large collections of mathematical functions and analytical tools.</p>
    <p>In this course, we will use the following libraries:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pandas - This library is used for structured data operations, like import CSV files, create dataframes, and data preparation</li>
        <li>Numpy - This is a mathematical library. Has a powerful N-dimensional array object, linear algebra, Fourier transform, etc.</li>
        <li>Matplotlib - This library is used for visualization of data.</li>
        <li>SciPy - This library has linear algebra modules</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will use these libraries throughout the course to create examples.</p>
