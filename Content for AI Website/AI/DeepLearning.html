        <p>The <b>deep learning revolution</b> started around 2010. <br><br>

            Since then, Deep Learning has solved many "unsolvable" problems. <br><br>
            
            The deep learning revolution was not started by a single discovery. It more or less happened when several needed factors were ready:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Computers were fast enough</li>
                <li>Computer storage was big enough</li>
                <li>Better training methods were invented</li>
                <li>Better tuning methods were invented</li>
            </ul>

    <h1>Neurons</h1>
    <p>Scientists agree that our brain has between 80 and 100 billion neurons. <br><br>

        These neurons have hundreds of billions connections between them.</p>
    <img src="images/25.png" alt="">
    <p>Neurons (aka Nerve Cells) are the fundamental units of our brain and nervous system. <br><br>

        The neurons are responsible for receiving input from the external world, for sending output (commands to our muscles), and for transforming the electrical signals in between.</p>

    <h1>Neural Networks</h1>
    <p><b>Artificial Neural Networks</b> are normally called Neural Networks (NN). <br><br>

        Neural networks are in fact multi-layer <b>Perceptrons</b>. <br><br>
        
        The perceptron defines the first step into multi-layered neural networks. <br><br>
        
        <b>Neural Networks</b> is the essence of <b>Deep Learning</b>. <br><br>
        
        <b>Neural Networks</b> is one of the most significant discoveries in history. <br><br>
        
        <b>Neural Networks</b> can solve problems that can NOT be solved by algorithms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Medical Diagnosis</li>
            <li>Face Detection</li>
            <li>Voice Recognition</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>The Neural Network Model</h1>
        <p>Input data (Yellow) are processed against a hidden layer (Blue) and modified against another hidden layer (Green) to produce the final output (Red).</p>

        <h1>Tom Mitchell</h1>
        <p>Tom Michael Mitchell (born 1951) is an American computer scientist and University Professor at the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). <br><br>

            He is a former Chair of the Machine Learning Department at CMU. <br><br>
            E: Experience (the number of times).
            T: The Task (driving a car).
            P: The Performance (good or bad). </p>
        <h1>The Giraffe Story</h1>
        <p>In 2015, <b>Matthew Lai</b>, a student at Imperial College in London created a neural network calledb     Giraffe. <br><br>

            Giraffe could be trained in 72 hours to play chess at the same level as an international master. <br><br>
            
            Computers playing chess are not new, but the way this program was created was new. <br><br>
            
            Smart chess playing programs take years to build, while Giraffe was built in 72 hours with a neural network</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Supervised Machine Learning</li>
                <li>UnSupervised Machine Learning</li>
                <li>Self-Supervised Machine Learning</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Deep Learning</h1>
        <p>Classical programming uses programs (algorithms) to create results: <br><br>Traditional Computing <br>
            Data + Computer Algorithm = Result <br><br>
            Machine Learning uses results to create programs (algorithms): <br><br>
            Machine Learning <br>
            Data + Result = Computer Algorithm
        </p>
        <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        <p>Machine Learning is often considered equivalent with Artificial Intelligence. <br><br>

            This is not correct. Machine learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. <br><br>
            
            Machine Learning is a discipline of AI that uses data to teach machines.</p>
        <h1>Intelligent Decision Formula</h1>
        <p><ul>
            <li>Save the result of all actions</li>
            <li>Simulate all possible outcomes</li>
            <li>Compare the new action with the old ones</li>
            <li>Check if the new action is good or bad</li>
            <li>Choose the new action if it is less bad</li>
            <li>Do it all over again</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>The fact that computers can do this millions of times, has proven that computers can take very intelligent decisions.</p>
