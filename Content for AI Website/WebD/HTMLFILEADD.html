        <h1>HTML File Paths
        </h1>
        <p>A file path specifies the location of a file inside a web folder structure. Its like an address of a file which helps the web browser to access the files. File paths are used to link external resources such as images, videos, style sheets, JavaScript, displaying other web pages etc.
            To insert a file in a web page its source must be known. For example, the syntax (<img src=” ” alt=” “>) is used to insert an image file, where the path of the file is mentioned in the source (src).</p>
