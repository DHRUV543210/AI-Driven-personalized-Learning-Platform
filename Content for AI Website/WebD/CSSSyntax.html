        <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
        <p>A CSS Syntax rule consists of a selector, property, and its value. The selector points to the HTML element where the CSS style is to be applied. The CSS property is separated by semicolons. It is a combination of the selector name followed by the property: value pair that is defined for the specific selector.</p>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p>selector{Property:value;}</p>
        <p>For instance, we have declared a heading tag (h1) along with having assigned some property: value pair that is used to style the heading tag. Here, h1 is the selector, { color: green; font-family: sans-serif; } is a declaration block and it can contain one or more declarations separated by semicolons, color: green; is a property: value pair that is applied to the HTML element to style them.</p>

        <p>Every declaration has a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon(:) and is surrounded by curly braces({ }). For declaring the multiple CSS properties, it can be separated by the semicolon(;).</p>
        <h3>Let's ddefinr each of these :</h3>
        <p>1.Declaration: A combination of a property and its corresponding value.</p>
        <p>2.Selector: Used to target and select specific HTML elements to apply styles to.</p>
        <p>3.Property: Defines the specific aspect or characteristic of an element that you want to modify.</p>
        <p>4.Value: Assigned setting or parameter for a given property, determining how the selected element should appear or behave.</p>
