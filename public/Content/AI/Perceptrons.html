    <h1>Frank Rosenblatt</h1>
    <p><b>Frank Rosenblatt</b> was an American psychologist notable in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

        In <b>1957</b> he started something really big. He "invented" a <b>Perceptron</b> program, on an IBM 704 computer at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory.
        
        Scientists had discovered that brain cells <b>(Neurons)</b> receive input from our senses by electrical signals.
        
        The Neurons, then again, use electrical signals to store information, and to make decisions based on previous input.
        
        Frank had the idea that <b>Perceptrons</b> could simulate brain principles, with the ability to learn and make decisions.</p>

    <h1>Perceptron Example</h1>
    <p>Imagine a perceptron (in your brain). <br><br>

        The perceptron tries to decide if you should go to a concert. <br><br>
        
        Is the artist good? Is the weather good?<br><br>
        
        What weights should these facts have?</p>

    <h1>The Perceptron Algorithm</h1>
    <p>Frank Rosenblatt suggested this algorithm:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Set a threshold value</li>
        <li>Multiply all inputs with its weights</li>
        <li>Sum all the results</li>
        <li>Activate the output</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>1. Seet a threshold value:</b></p>
    <ul><li>Threshold = 1.5</li></ul>
    <p><b>2. Multiply all inputs with its weights:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>x1 * w1 = 1 * 0.7 = 0.7</li>
        <li>x2 * w2 = 0 * 0.6 = 0</li>
        <li>x3 * w3 = 1 * 0.5 = 0.5</li>
        <li>x4 * w4 = 0 * 0.3 = 0</li>
        <li>x5 * w5 = 1 * 0.4 = 0.4</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>3. Sum all the results</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>0.7 + 0 + 0.5 + 0 + 0.4 = 1.6 (The Weighted Sum)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>4. Activate the Output:</b></p>
    <ul><li>Return true if the sum > 1.5 ("Yes I will go to the Concert")</li></ul>

    <div class="yellow" id="percepyellow">
        <h1>Note</h1>
        <p>If the weather weight is 0.6 for you, it might be different for someone else. A higher weight means that the weather is more important to them. <br><br>

            If the threshold value is 1.5 for you, it might be different for someone else. A lower threshold means they are more wanting to go to any concert.</p>

    <h1>Perceptron Terminology</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Perceptron Inputs (nodes)</li>
        <li>Node values (1, 0, 1, 0, 1)</li>
        <li>Node Weights (0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3, 0.4)</li>
        <li>Activation Function (sum > treshold)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Nodes (Perceptron Inputs)</h1>
    <p>Perceptron inputs are called <b>nodes</b>.

        The nodes have both a <b>value</b> and a <b>weight</b>.</p>
    <h1>Node Values (Input Values)</h1>
    <p>Each input node has a binary value of <b>1 or 0</b>. <br><br>

        This can be interpreted as <b>true or false</b> / <b>yes or no</b>. <br><br>
        
        In the example above, the node values are: 1, 0, 1, 0, 1</p>
    <h1>Node Weights</h1>
    <p>Weights shows the <b>strength</b> of each node.

        In the example above, the node weights are: 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.3, 0.4</p>

    <h1>The Activation Function</h1>
    <p>The activation function maps the the weighted sum into a binary value of <b>1 or 0</b>. <br><br>

        This can be interpreted as <b>true or false</b> / <b>yes or no</b>. <br><br>
        
        In the example above, the activation function is simple: (sum > 1.5)</p>

        <h1>Note</h1>
        <p>It is obvious that a decision is NOT made by <b>one neuron</b> alone. <br><br>

            Many other neurons must provide input:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is the artist good</li>
                <li>Is the weather good</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Multi-Layer Perceptrons </b>can be used for very sophisticated decision making.</p>
