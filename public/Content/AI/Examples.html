    <h1>Artificial Music Intelligence</h1>
    <p>Can an algorithm compose better music than a human?<br><br>

        David Cope is a former professor of music at the University of Santa Cruz (California). <br><br>
        
        For over 30 years, David Cope has been developing Emmy or EMI (Experimental Musical Intelligence), an algorithm to compose music in the style of famous composers.</p>

        <h1>Bach, Larson, or EMI?</h1>
        <p>In a test performed by professor Douglas Hofstadter of the University of Oregon, a pianist performed three musical pieces in the style of Bach:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>One Written by Bach</li>
            <li>One written by Steve Larson</li>
            <li>One written by EMI</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dr. Larson was hurt when the audience concluded that his piece was written by EMI. <br><br>

            He felt better when the listeners decided that the piece composed by EMI was a genuine Bach. <br><br>

        <div class="yellow">
            <p>The <b>corona Pandemic</b> pushed the need for optimizing <b>Medical healthcare</b></p>
        </div>
        <p>Machine learning is a new technology that can provide better drug discovery, shorter development time, and lower drug costs.

            Machine Learning enables healthcare to use "big data" for making better medical or clinical decisions.</p>
