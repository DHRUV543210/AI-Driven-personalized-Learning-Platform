        <p>up to <b>80%</b> of a Machine Learning project is about <b>Collecting Data:</b> <br><br><ul>

    <h1>What is Data?</h1>
    <p>Data can be many things. <br><br>

    With Machine Learning, data is collections of facts:</p>

    <h1>Intelligence Needs Data</h1>
    <p>Human intelligence needs data: <br><br>

        A real estate broker needs data about sold houses to estimate prices. <br><br>
        
        Artificial Intelligence also needs data: <br><br>
        
    A Machine Learning program needs data to estimate prices.</p>
    <div class="yellow" id="datayellow">
        <p>Data can help us to see and understand. <br><br>

            Data can help us to find new opportunities. <br><br>
            
            Data can help us to resolve misunderstandings.</p>
    </div>
    <h1>Healthcare</h1>
    <p>Healthcare and life sciences collect public health data and patient data to learn how to improve patient care and save lives.</p>
    <h1>Business</h1>
    <p>The most successful companies in many sectors are data driven. They use sophisticated data analytics to learn how the company can perform better.</p>
    <h1>Finance</h1>
    <p>Banks and insurance companies collect and evaluate data about customers, loans and deposits to support strategic decision-making.</p>
    <h1>Storing Data</h1>
    <p>The most common data to collect are Numbers and Measurements. <br><br>

        Often data are stored in arrays representing the relationship between values. <br><br>
        
        This table contains house prices versus size:</p>

    <h1>Quantitative vs. Qualitative</h1>
    <p>Quantitative data are numerical:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>55 cars</li>
        <li>15 meters</li>
        <li>35 children</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Qualitative data are descriptive:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It is cold</li>
        <li>It is long</li>
        <li>It was fun</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A <b>Census</b> is when we collect data for every member of a group. <br><br>

        A <b>Sample</b> is when we collect data for some members of a group. <br><br>
        
        If we wanted to know how many Americans smoke cigarettes, we could ask every person in the US (a census), or we could ask 10 000 people (a sample). <br><br>
        
        A census is <b>Accurate</b>, but hard to do. A sample is <b>Inaccurate</b>, but is easier to do.</p>
    <h1>Sampling Terms</h1>
    <p>A <b>Population</b> is group of individuals (objects) we want to collect information from. <br><br>

        A <b>Census</b> is information about every individual in a population. <br><br>
        
        A <b>Sample</b> is information about a part of the population (In order to represent all).</p>
    <h1>Random Samples</h1>
    <p>In order for a sample to represent a population, it must be collected randomly. <br><br>

        A <b>Random Sample</b>, is a sample where every member of the population has an equal chance to appear in the sample.</p>
    <h1>Sampling Bias</h1>
    <p>A <b>Sampling Bias</b> (Error) occurs when samples are collected in such a way that some individuals are less (or more) likely to be included in the sample.
    </p>
    <h1>Big Data</h1>
    <p>Big data is data that is impossible for humans to process without the assistance of advanced machines. <br><br>

        Big data does not have any definition in terms of size, but datasets are becoming larger and larger as we continously collect more and more data and store data at a lower and lower cost.</p>
    <h1>Data Mining</h1>
    <p>With big data comes complicated data structures. <br><br>

        A huge part of big data processing is refining data.</p>
