            <h1>Basic Structure of web page</h1> 
            <p>The basic structure of an HTML page is given below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) to create web page.</p>
        
            <h2>HTML Basic Elements</h2>

            <p><DOCTYPE! html> – A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.</p>

            <p><html> – It is used to define the root element of an HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.

            </p>

            <p><head> – This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document. It contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the webpage.

            </p>
            <p><body> – It is used to enclose all visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.

            </p>
