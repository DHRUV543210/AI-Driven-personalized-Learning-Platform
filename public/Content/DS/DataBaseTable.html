    <h1>Database table</h1>
    <p>A database table is a table with structured data.</p>
    <p>The following table shows a database table with health data extracted from a sports watch:</p>

    <p>This dataset contains information of a typical training session such as duration, average pulse, calorie burnage etc.</p>
    <h2>Database Table Structure</h2>
    <p>A database table consists of column(s) and row(s):</p>
    <img src="images/5.png" alt="">
    <p>A row is a horizontal representation of data.</p>
    <p>A column is a vertical representation of data.</p>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>A variable is defined as something that can be measured or counted.</p>
    <p>Examples can be characters, numbers or time.</p>
    <p>In the example under, we can observe that each column represents a variable.</p>
    <img src="images/6.png" alt="">
    <p>There are 6 columns, meaning that there are 6 variables (Duration, Average_Pulse, Max_Pulse, Calorie_Burnage, Hours_Work, Hours_Sleep).</p>
    <p>There are 11 rows, meaning that each variable has 10 observations.</p>
    <div class="yellow" id="yellowdatabase">
        <p>But if there are 11 rows, how come there are only 10 observations?</p>
        <p><b>It is because the first row is the label, meaning that it is the name of the variable.</b></p>
