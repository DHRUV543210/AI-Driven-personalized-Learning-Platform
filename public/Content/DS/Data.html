    <h1>What is Data ?</h1>
    <p>Data is a collection of information.</p>
    <p>One purpose of Data Science is to structure data, making it interpretable and easy to work with.</p>
    <p>Data can be categorized into two groups:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Structured Data</li>
        <li>Unstructured Data</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Unstructured Data</h2>
    <p>Unstructured data is not organized. We must organize the data for analysis purposes.</p>

    <h2>How to Structure Data?</h2>
    <p>We can use an array or a database table to structure or present data.</p>
    <p>Example of an array:</p>
    <p>[80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125]</p>
    <p>The following example shows how to create an array in Python:</p>

        <p>It is common to work with very large data sets in Data Science.</p>
        <p>In this tutorial we will try to make it as easy as possible to understand the concepts of Data Science. We will therefore work with a small data set that is easy to interpret.</p>
