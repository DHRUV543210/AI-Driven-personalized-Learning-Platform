    <p>This chapter shows three commonly used functions when working with Data Science: max(), min(), and mean().</p>
    <h1>The Sports Watch Data Set</h1>
    <img src="images/11.png" alt="">
    <p>The data set above consists of 6 variables, each with 10 observations:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>Duration - </b>How long lasted the training session in minutes?</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Average_Pulse - </b>What was the average pulse of the training session? This is measured by beats per minute</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Max_Pulse - </b>What was the max pulse of the training session?</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Calorie_Burnage - </b>How much calories were burnt on the training session?</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Hours_Work - </b>How many hours did we work at our job before the training session?</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Hours_Sleep - </b>How much did we sleep the night before the training session?</p></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="green" id="functiongreen">
        <p>We use underscore (_) to separate strings because Python cannot read space as separator.</p>

    <h2>The max() function</h2>
    <p>The Python max() function is used to find the highest value in an array.</p>
    <img src="images/12.png" alt="">
    <h2>The min() function</h2>
    <p>The Python min() function is used to find the lowest value in an array.</p>
    <img src="images/13.png" alt="">
    <h2>The mean() function</h2>
    <p>The NumPy mean() function is used to find the average value of an array.</p>

    <div class="yellow">
        <p><b>Note: </b>We write <b>np.</b> in front of <b>mean</b> to let Python know that we want to activate the <b>mean</b> function from the <b>Numpy</b> library.</p>
